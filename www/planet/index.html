LibreCores.org is currently under development
and needs constant improvement. We are always searching for developers
that are interested to contribute to the development of
LibreCores.org. From designing, to writing of
documentation and code, to testing: there are opportunities to contribute from
small to large, from novice to experienced programmer, writer or designer.

        The introduction to the second chapter of
The Art of Electronics
bemoans the traditional treatment of transistor models where “circuit behavior
tends to be revealed to you as something that drops out of elaborate equations,
rather than deriving from a clear understanding in your own mind as to how the
circuit functions…” The chapter goes on to build both a mental
model (“transistor man”) and a set of equations (Ebers-Moll) in parallel.

I like this philosophy: knowing how to compute  ...

This year I have the privilige to represent the FOSSi Foundation in the EDA Devroom, organized by our friend Javier Serrano.
I’ll talk about Digital hardware design: What can we learn from software development – and what not.
Join me for a look at processes and tools that make the lifes of developers, both of software and hardware, easier.
What can we learn from each other?
Where are different approaches needed?

“Shop Class as Soulcraft.”
I enjoyed the book, but one section struck me in particular. The author, who runs a motorcycle repair shop,
relates a story of a customer who brought him an
83 Honda Magna V45 motorcycle
that had been sitting in storage for years and wouldn’t start. After
unsuccessfully trying to talk the owner out of it, he discovered and repaired the
problem that was keeping the bike from starting. But he noticed the bike also
had a small oil leak. On  ...

        In the last post I described
a challenge with implementing closures that capture by reference.

The Lua 5.0 VM has an interesting solution to this problem,
described in section 5 of this document.
The inner function always accesses free variables (which they refer to as
‘outer local variables’) indirectly through a structure called an ‘upval’ using
the instructions GETUPVAL and SETUPVAL. While the enclosing function is active,
the upval points to the local variable slot on the stack (though  ...

        A while back, I built a Lisp machine
that runs on FPGA. One feature that was lacking was support for lexical
closures. I used some extra time over the recent break to add support for them.

Full source code is here:

Background

One inspiration for this project was an MIT AI Memo
that describes a machine that natively runs a dialect of Scheme,

        Abstract

Device trees are used to communicate existence of non-discoverable hardware,
such as where scratchpad memory appears in the processor’s address space,
to an operating system.
Newer platforms, such as RISC-V,
offer the opportunity to design systems in a way that obviates the need for complexities such as device trees;
yet, these opportunities are often not exploited.
The Kestrel-3 is designed to minimize its need for any kind of device tree-like concept through,
in part,

        Ok, so everything is done. I&#039;ve done enough testing to make sure the new features work as expected and none of the old stuff is broken. The sources are just waiting to be tagged and uploaded to pypi. The blog post about the new release is written, and all I need is a catchy introduction. Oh, I know. It&#039;s christmas, so I should write something funny about FuseSoC being the best gift this year. Or wait, I take a christmas song and change some words so that it&#039;s about FuseSoC instead.

        Yesterday, lowRISC triggered a lot of discussion when someone submitted it to
Hacker News. The comment
thread became something of an
impromptu Q+A about our project direction and status. I thought it was worth
linking to it here and highlighting the discussion for a wider audience. If

        Abstract

The Kestrel-3 computer design should be portable to a reasonable number of different FPGA development boards.
However, each board offers different hardware resources, interfaces, RAM sizes, and other attributes that directly affects compatbility.
Instead of building system firmware images for specific configurations of specific FPGA boards, producing a combinatorial explosion of firmware images which must be maintained and tested, it would be far simpler if we can break things  ...

OpenSoC System Architect: Farzad Fatollahi-Fard


Current architectures are wasteful. Only a small fraction of chip area goes
to computation.
For both GoblinCore and OpenHPC, ended up doing a lot of similar work to
achieve only a point design. Why not make a generator to avoid repeating the
same steps?
OpenSoC System Architect is a combination of multiple  ...

        In a previous post,
I observed that, as I increased the number of cores in my
GPGPU, performance began to
plateau and hardware threads spent more time stalled because their store queue
was full. I speculated that the latter might cause the latter, although that
wasn’t definitive. The current implementation only has a single store queue
entry for each thread. One optimization I’ve been considering is adding more
store queue entries, but this has subtle and complex design tradeoffs.

        Back in June, during the LimeSDR crowdfunding campaign, one of the many great demos that we shared details of was a basic Vector Network Analyser (VNA). Since then we’ve understandably had quite a few requests to share the code and this was always the intention, but the engineers at Lime Micro wanted to first spend some time tidying it up and putting together documentation. Well, I’m delighted to report that this has now been completed and the code can be found on GitHub.

        Receiving AX.25 with LuaRadio and LimeSDR
LuaRadio is a lightweight, embeddable flow graph signal processing framework for SDR and as the name suggests, it is written in the Lua language. It benefits from no external hard dependencies and a binary footprint of an impressively small &lt;750KB, which even includes the LuaJIT just-in-time compiler.
In short, LuaRadio provides an environment similar to GNU Radio and that is also complete with source, sink and processing blocks — albeit without the  ...

        We would like to announce the preliminary SNAPSHOT release of Chisel3.  Chisel3 is the Chisel version used by the RISC-V Rocket Chip Generator and is what we will be supporting and developing moving forward.  As such, we highly encourage you all to move over to it.  In order to do so, please import chisel3._ instead of Chisel._ in your Chisel designs.

        I&#039;ve found myself in a strange position recently defending IP-XACT on a number of occasions. Most recently there were some heated discussions with lots of hand gestures at orconf. The heat and hand gestures however might have been due to the fact that we were in Italy. Still, there were discussions.So let me get this straight once and for all by quoting one of the great thinkers of the 21st century.

        This blog post is a slight departure from the normal topics here. Worry not,
we’ll return to discussing Verilog, Chisel, and low-level software work soon.
I wrote a quick script to help serve a need (producing a Gantt chart) and
thought perhaps others would find it useful.

There are a wide range of online services to help produce and maintain Gantt
charts, but none quite offered what I was looking for. I want something open
source, easy to use, and where the underlying data is human  ...

Contest for the first time and it was a great success. We received
six high quality submissions of open source silicon and its ecosystem
from the last year (since October 2015).

The design contest put the focus on the openness of a design, which
includes aspects like (re-)usability, an easy entry and the potential
to build a substantial community around it.

        Lets get snappy! Snaps are a containerization system that makes it easy to package and distribute a complete set of dependencies and files needed for an application. As an example, several snaps are now available on the LimeNet store for the Lime Suite GUI, Pothos GUI, GQRX, and GNURadio companion. In this blog, I will cover basics about creating and installing snaps, and provide instructions for using the snaps on the LimeNet store.

Both new features strengthen our collaborations with other projects – because sharing is caring!

        The time to get started with digital hardware development has never been better. Tools are more readily available, FPGAs get cheaper and reasonably sized boards can be obtained easily. Yet hardware development looks like a scary place to many developers coming from the software world. Sometimes it’s just naming that’s different, sometimes it’s missing documentation and being lost in choices that make it hard to dive in.

At that point I realized that it would be better to write those bits as part of the documentation. Yes, you read it right. Documentation. This release has 45% more documentation than previous releases. A massive increase from 245 lines to 368 lines. Oh  ...

        Prior to the 0.67.0 release the OSVVM library included with VUnit was a
modified copy of the original project to support GHDL. Nowadays the OSVVM
project supports GHDL natively and it is also available from GitHub so we
made it a submodule instead. The submodule is a way
to keep another Git repository (OSVVM) in a subdirectory of the VUnit
repository while keeping their histories separate. Updates to OSVVM doesn’t
affect the VUnit history and vice versa. This makes no difference if  ...

        Now that Google Summer of Code 2016 is approaching its end, the current status of the project is reported here, split on what was completed and what wasn&#039;t due to reasons that were out of our immediate control. The numbers correspond to the original proposal&#039;s milestones.

As mentioned on previous blog posts, everything developed for this project can be found on the Parallella RISC-V repository. Moreover, for users that don&#039;t have a working Vivado installation or just want to test  ...

        It&#039;s that time again when I&#039;ve started a new project at work. Since we&#039;re going to be using some new proprietary interfaces in this chip, this calls for some new UVCs. I wouldn&#039;t even consider developing a new UVC without setting up a unit testing environment for it first. Since this is a greenfield project, a lot of the specifications are volatile, meaning that the interface protocol can change at any moment. Having tests in place can help make sure that I don&#039;t miss anything. Even if the  ...

        I&#039;ve been writing more and more SystemVerilog assertions (SVAs) lately. I find that they are the best way to capture temporal requirements, allowing the rest of the (class-based) testbench to stay timing agnostic. Since assertions are a key part of the checking infrastructure we need to make sure that they&#039;re bulletproof. This means that we need to test them to make sure that they&#039;re doing what we expect them to do.
The typical flow when writing an assertion is the following (for me, at  ...

been in Boston this week for the fourth RISC-V workshop. By any measure, this
has been a massive success with over 250 attendees representing 63 companies

The general aim of this project will be to create a generic development board for the FPGA. This isn’t as simple as it is for a microcontroller because an FPGA can become pretty much anything you want it to be and the resulting support circuitry is always tailored to the desired use case.

        The precious Parallella board (Kickstarter edition) arrived this week and I&#039;ve been playing with it non-stop. This board contains the bigger Zynq FPGA device (7020) and thus it is capable of holding large designs like the full RISC-V IMAFD core generated with rocket-chip. Before testing my project though I had to make sure that the board works fine with just the latest Parallella E-SDK (2016.3.1) image loaded in the SD card. In this release page of the E-SDK you can find image archives for  ...

        Begnning on Monday, June 27th, we had a team of four University of
Cambridge undergrads begin a 10 week
internship working on the lowRISC project at the Computer Laboratory,
kindly sponsored by IMC Financial Markets (who are also
helping to advise this project). The team will be blogging regularly over the
course of the summer - I’ll pass over to them to introduce
themselves.

After some initial brainstorming, we decided to aim to extend the
current lowRISC SoC design to enable video  ...
